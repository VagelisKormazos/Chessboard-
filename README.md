 queen. Each player gets up to two points each round depending on whether he eats an opponent's piece. Thus,
 white can get 2 points if his rook eats his queen and so does his bishop. If only
 one of his pieces eats the queen then he gets one point. Similarly, black gets two points if
 his queen can eat both of white's pieces or one if he can only eat one. After 100 games,
 display the points of the two players.
